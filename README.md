## Ingredients

- 130g Unsalted Butter (Browned)
- 200g Dark Brown Sugar
- 60g White Sugar
- 1 Egg
- 1tsp Vanilla Extract
- 1tsp Baking Soda
- 1tsp Salt
- 150g Plain Flour
- 150g Chocolate

### If wanting to make a chocolate dough

- 50g Cocoa Powder
- 110g Plain Flour

### Notes

- Do not use baking powder, this will lead to a more cakey cookie.
- For chocolate, I recommend buying a bar of cooking chocolate and cutting into chunks. Chocolate chips will also work fine though.
- You can try other ratios of brown and white sugar, more brown leads to denser cookie more moist cookies and white makes it more fluffier and sweeter.
