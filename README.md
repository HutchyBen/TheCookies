## Ingredients
- 130g Unsalted butter (Browned)
- 200g Dark brown sugar
- 60g White sugar
- 1 egg
- 1tsp Vanilla extract
- 1tsp Baking soda
- 1tsp Salt
- 150g Plain flour
- 150g Chocolate
#### If wanting to make a chocolate dough
- 50g Cocoa powder
- 110g Plain flour 
### Notes
- Do not use baking powder this will lead to a more cakey cookie
- For chocolate, I recommend buying a bar of cooking chocolate and cutting into chunks. Chocolate chips will also work fine though
- You can try other ratios of brown and white sugar, more brown leads to denser cookie more moist cookies and white makes it more fluffier and sweeter.

13. Once ready to bake, Heat oven to 165Â°C
14. Wait till oven is at temperature
15. Insert baking tray with cookies into oven for 9 minutes.
